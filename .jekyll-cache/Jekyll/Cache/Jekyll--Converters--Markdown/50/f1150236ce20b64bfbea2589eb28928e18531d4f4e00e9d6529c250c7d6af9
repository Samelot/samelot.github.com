<p>Some day, you may be browsing the web, reading a new blog or article, and all of a sudden, reality smacks you in the face.. <strong>You have misaligned your screen protector.</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs good practice to change your screen protector when needed. Put on a new one on as edges start to chip. Chips usually develop further and make their way into the use-space of your screen. The worst is when these develop into thin, long cracks, because I‚Äôll start to play with them by bending them back and forth. I‚Äôve noticed that doing this is actually like playing with tiny shards of glass, and that more than once, I have cut my thumb while handling my phone. These can even slice into my pants pockets if I‚Äôm not careful and make holes in my clothes! So for all these reasons, it‚Äôs pretty important to insure your screen protector is unscathed.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Website Formatting:</strong></p>

<p>I find that the most critical part of the screen protector application process is getting the edges to align perfectly. With a sloppy job, you will notice that one side cuts off text on one side or while using your phone in portrait mode the tops of notification icons are cut off.</p>

<p>Detecting that you‚Äôve screwed up the alignment of your screen protector is tricky, as most sites have good formatting, keeping some margin space. It‚Äôs when you stumble onto the rare outlier. poorly formatted website
Coming across an outlier, a site with no margins/padding, so use this page when aligning your protector and you‚Äôll be better off.</p>
