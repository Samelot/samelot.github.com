<!-- Me and my Daddio (a friend I call Daddio, not my actual dad), after only one year of HeyTell, have created a rather large collection of HeyTells.

The term “HeyTells” refers to a voice message or recording that is generated by the app - in our case, this is done in excess.  

Having used HeyTell for only one year, me and my Daddio (not my dad) have created a rather large collection of HeyTells.

I can’t imagine there being another duo that rival our total conversation time. And I’m not just bragging about quantity, but quality too! Our HeyTells are prolific -->

It would seem that our HeyTell duo is the greatest duo - being contributors to such an immense library of prolific content. Supporting our collaboration has probably caused HeyTell some considerable strain (server strain). Many times we’ll experience technical difficulties as we flood each other will our nonsensical blabberings. Their servers crash or something. Here’s what some of our messages might look like, transcribed:

+ Transcribed HeyTell

<!-- Storing the conversation, messages sent from either recipient. Explain a little better. -->

Messages recieved are grouped together under the same label - the recipient's username. This is does automatically and provides for some neatness. Occasionally messages overflow into another label (of the same username), directing all futures messages there. A healthy library of HeyTells might look something like this:

<!-- Issues with images in table.. Fix This ! -->

|Each row represents a grouping of messages|Messages within a group|

It has come to be, at least in my library, that these groups/folders are arranged chronologically, with about a month’s worth of HeyTell material. Big chunked up, cluttered, chunky libraries like this must be handled with delicacy, as a few times I’ve accidently permanently (rewritten) deleted, lost one of them (months work)... Don’t ask me how.. After a disaster/complication/loss like this, I quickly start planning on a backup strategy/plan.

HeyTell doesn’t really provide/offer any real convinent way to unload/backup all messages easily to your computer. You can email .wav files of the messages, but only of messages that you recorded, messages sent to you are prohibited from being exported. Even if you were to email yourself recordings of all your messages, it would be tedious and time consuming.

Because I'd like to archive all of these HeyTells, and because they're so damn many of them, I will use Reaper...

Reaper/This is a great tool for those that demand fine control over audio processing and that want to treat their audio files like true long-term assets. Using markers and regions, batch rendering and export options become very accessible. 

<!--And if you prefer working within another application, or with hardware, just use Reaper as a tool to resample and embellish audio, bringing your processed audio back into your main program later.-->

<!-- In Ableton, the program I'm most comfortable with, I have found that trying to resample and, more importantly, name and save audio files in Ableton to be a slow, painful process. The (rendering) “Export Audio/Video” tool offers only few different ways to access to the content of your set. It provides no batch export.

I have found that trying to execute this level of control 

I have found that Ableton doesn’t offer this level of control.

Two examples of this kind of control:

>ex.1
>There were many times where I would want to resample certain parts of my track, saving them with a unique name and storing them in “Englander Files” (my sample folder). Where going through the render dialog box, setting up a render area/region would be too much work (especially for a 1 second sample on a single track), I opted for a slightly different process:
>
>+ Create a new track in Ableton.
>+ Audio From: (the track I want to sample)
>+ Arm this new track, and record (hit a record [img] button on a session slot).
>+ Locate the file, should be automatically stored in the folder of the Live set your working in.
>+ Copy and paste this file in “Englander Files”.
>
>That was my work around and I don’t recommend it.

{: .jabo .centered-table-content}

And I always was very cautious to save any presets or samples into my Englander Files folder. I didn’t want to get mixed up in Ableton’s library. I much prefer to keep my personal stuff separate from the program’s environment - not storying my stuff in their libraries. 

ex.2 
Batch Render Example:

I have an audio file of me screaming, and I want to process it 10 times, applying a different effect each time. 

I have an audio recording of me screaming and I want to export this 10 times (rendering 10 separate audio files). Each render will applying a different set of effects. Each filename will contain the same name, but append a sequential id. ex: scream1.wav, scream2.wav, scream3.wav... 

Doing this in Reaper: Possible, a delight
Doing this in Ableton: borderlineImpossible, nightmare

In my short time with Reaper, I have found that these workflows, as seen in the above examples, are well handled/supported and encouraged. 

It’s important to be able to build an organized library of samples and presets, (which) not only to serve as an accessible environment/environments where one defines their style, but also as building blocks to quickly create tracks that you can get back to where you left off sooner, build your tracks faster more efficiently. 

My first few storage dumps were made in Ableton Live, but in general, Ableton lacks a lot of control for handling meticulous little details, such as batch exporting. Like I’ve said before, Reaper fm is great for this sort of thing. There seems to be no limit to what you can do, and this can be pretty overwhelming. Here is how I did it:

##Workflow using Reaper and Max/MSP

In a brief/quick overview/synopsis of what we be doing: using Max/MSP to dictate when we record in Reaper based on the silences/gaps between playingback HeyTell messages.

This process requires me to go through my HeyTell library and ensure playback of each message, so that audio can be (subsequently) recorded into Reaper. The manual labor of playing each message is unavoidable, however, we can make things easier on us by (deciding/determining) how/when we record in Reaper.

<!-- REMIND READER:
The desired outcome/output of this process is: Each individual HeyTell rendered to a .wav file, named in accordance to some scheme. (accordance, correspond, conforming). 
- I would have to determine how to record, or when to record.-->

<!--Knowing this is important because given Reaper's batch process settings, we will want to conduct ourselves particular way.

- I would have to determine how to record, or when to record.

If not, I’m going to end up with a lot of blank dead audio space, which I would have to later go in and edit out.. 

Remember that the desired outcome of this process will be: Each individual HeyTell (HeyTell message), rendered to a .wav file and named in accordance to some naming scheme.
-->
Write about how reaper handles batch processing:

- Regions.
- Items can be easily set to regions (with corresponding item names).

Visualize and consider each of these workflows (and keep in mind that we will be going through hundreds, thousands of HeyTells).

>- Enable record in Reaper → Playback single HeyTell message → Disable record in Reaper.
>- Enable record in Reaper → Playback entire HeyTell collection → Disable record in Reaper.

Both these options would really take away the pleasure of being able to sit back can enjoy each message as it played - on one hand (the former), being too focused on remembering to enable/disable record before and after each message, and on the other hand (the later), having to go back through a giant file and manually set markers.. (better wording)

The desired outcome/output of this process is: Each individual HeyTell rendered to a .wav file, named in accordance to some scheme. (accordance, correspond, conforming). 

My effort and involvement in conducting this batch process should be minimal (kept to a minimum). I’d like to be able to play each HeyTell and enjoy listening to it, not have to worry about mucking up the whole process. (being sure I am recording while I am playing each message back.)

A first step:
- I would have to determine when and how to record in Reaper

An unconvention, cumbersome way might be:
- Enable record in Reaper → Playback single HeyTell message → Disable record in Reaper.
- Enable record in Reaper → Playback entire HeyTell collection → Disable record in Reaper.

My solution with some help from Max/msp:

I just hacked away at some examples I picked off the Max forums. Credits:::

In summary, the Max patch listen to the same audio source that is being sent into Reaper, and when it rises above a certain threshold (which it most certainly will as the difference between a no input vs heytell message, even a quiet heytell message with no talking, is pretty distinct) What were my settings.

When the input volume goes over the specified threshold, these actions are triggered in Reaper via Open Sound Control:

Transport: Pause

When the input volume goes under the specified threshold, these actions are triggered in Reaper via Open Sound Control:
Markers: Insert marker at current position
Transport: Play

I noticed a couple instances where, upon transitioning above/below the threshold, (one or two) extra pairs of these triggers were fired. This is no big deal. When going through these wavs after they are batched render, you can just find the insufficient pop that got pushed/segregated from the heytell, making its way into its own file. Maybe someone can fix this issue, I couldn’t. Playing the with the threshold level is done to minimize this issue.

I’d like to make clear that, this Max patch does not output audio. It’s not as though Reaper and Max are sending audio to each other here. They listen to the same source/input, input source. Max just sends OSC messages to Reaper telling it what to do.

By doing this we are are automatically minimizing, leaving out all the extra recorded space between each HeyTell. We are only recording when a HeyTell message when it is playing. (not using Transport: Record … is that right? Check!) By using Transport: Pause and Transport: Play rather than Transport: Stop, we are recording this chain of HeyTells to a single wav. We can consider this our source file, with which we will separate out into separate HeyTells next. I guess it’s just convenient if for some reason you wanted to have a consolidated source of your bulk HeyTells for backup purposes.. Then pick only the best HeyTells to render into separate .wavs. 

The action, Markers: Insert marker at current position, triggered just before Transport: Play plants a marker to signal the start of a new HeyTell message. These markers will be converted into regions, so that the batch render knows to export/segregate them to separate files/wavs.

I have exported these actions. Explain. In Max, you may have to change these messages to correspond to the Custom ID of the action.

NNN

In Reaper:

We are ready to convert these markers to regions and render them. SWS Extensions plugin for Reaper, this supplies this action. Download here.

search action
sws: convert

in a table...
convert markers to regions | _SWSMARKERLIST13

Once SWS Extensions (proper name?) are installed, you’ll be able to find this action in the action list.
? = action list shortcut

When this action is ran, we’ll see all our markers convert to regions, spanning from one marker to the next. 

Now we’ll render all of our regions..

opt+cmd+R: Render…

In the “Render bounds” section of the Render popup, dialog box, select from the drop-down menu, “Project regions”. Upon doing so (taking this step), you will see that the number of files that will be rendered will be the number of markers (now regions) that were generated by our Max patch, respectively?.. 

In the “Output” section, in the line/row to specify a “File name:”, select on the “Wildcard” button to reveal a drop-down menu. Here are dynamic variables to choose from, when naming files in a batch render process. They correspond to data in our Reaper project.

You might choose something like,

HeyTells-From-Santa_$region
HeyTells-From-XMAS_$region
HeyTells-From-Christmas_$region
ChristmasHeyTells_$region
SantasHeyTells_$region
