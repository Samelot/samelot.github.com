## Disclaimer:

Keep in mind that the these Tasks were made and tested on the **Resurrection Remix LuisROM** (Android Nougat) for Oneplus 5T.

+ [luis-builds.de](http://luis-builds.de/downloads/lineageos/rr/oneplus5t/)

For those more curious about this ROM, [check out this in-depth review](http://en.miui.com/thread-616732-1-1.html). It provides a very detailed inspection on the many screens and configuration options. This ROM is the first custom ROM Iâ€™ve ever used and I found it to be magnificent!

*It seems the developer discontinued work on his Nougat RR ROM to focus more time on Oreo.*

Enjoy :)
